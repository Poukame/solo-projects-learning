## Overview

This was my first project using React. The goal was to reproduce the card design from a Figma template.

## My process

Using the components structure of React was a bit disorientating at first but I managed to get the design.
I probably could have reduce the number of components.

I think the hardest part was to get the project online and published on Netlify. I faced many problem and I eventually managed and learned a lot about the build process, NPM and Netlify toml.

### Built with

- React App
- Based on Figma Design

### What I learned

The main learning points are :
- Using React components and JSX
